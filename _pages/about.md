Hey! I’m Nehansh Dave, a **Java Developer** with around two years of hands-on work experience in software development, system design, and back-end engineering. I graduated with a B.Eng. in Information & Communication Technology from [Gujarat Technological University](https://www.gtu.ac.in/), in 2022. Since then, I've been deeply involved in building efficient and innovative software solutions for clients.

In my current role as an Associate Consultant at [Inexture Solutions Ltd.](https://www.inexture.com/), I develop robust back-end applications, focusing on creating solutions that elevate client processes and streamline operations. I prioritize Agile methodologies, leveraging tools like **Spring Boot, Spring Security, Microservices, Hibernate, and Docker** to bring agile, secure, and scalable applications to life. My technical toolkit includes **Java EE, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, JSP, JSTL, Kafka,** and a solid understanding of cloud technologies, including **AWS and DigitalOcean**.

While working at Inexture Solutions Ltd., I’ve engaged in diverse projects like the **'Internal Control System'** for the German Federal Employment Agency, creating and optimizing API responses and ensuring seamless integration for Angular-based front-end teams, and **'Nexus Property Connect'**, where I developed API-based dashboards for real-time analytics and role-based authentication features. I’m also proud of my contributions as a Java Trainee at Axisray, StackCodie Pvt Ltd and a Cybersecurity Intern at Hackersdaddy Inc., where I gained invaluable industry exposure.

During my academic journey, I've enjoyed serving in leadership roles, such as a Cadet Warrant Officer in the [National Cadet Corps(NCC)](https://indiancc.nic.in/); as a key member of my institute's annual Arduino Workshop Core Committee; as a Public Relations Volunteer at the Pramukh Swami Maharaj [Centenary Celebrations](https://psm100.org/). Currently, I still volunteer for various social causes at [BAPS](https://baps.org/) non-profit Organization.
